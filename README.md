# Python Based Port Scanner

A multithreaded port scanner script built with Python to efficiently scan open ports on a target IP address. Ideal for network administrators and cybersecurity enthusiasts.

## Features
- **Multi-threading:** Utilizes threading for faster scanning.
- **Customizable Range:** Scan user-defined port ranges.
- **Timeout Handling:** Configurable timeout settings.
- **Error Handling:** Robust error handling for various network scenarios.
- **Result Logging:** Saves scan results to a file for later analysis.

## Installation
